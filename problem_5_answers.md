Questions

Consider the provided sample code this Gist and answer the following questions:

What's missing? Is this bar chart usable in its current form?
The existing sample code does label the axis, it does provide an easy way to rank or sort the data. 


What is the role of each of the three nested levels of g elements? (keep in mind you'll be adding a title to the chart)
g elements allow the elements to be grouped and make it easier to manager the elements. 

Complete the implementation section below. Is there any consequence if you add the text elements before or after the rect elements? Why?
No. Since they are grouped there is no consequence. If it was not grouped, after sorting each element would be required to be moved and transformed.
