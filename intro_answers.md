*Answers to Intro Questions*

If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

If we were interested in summary statistics, I would list the states in rows and have 3-5 columns for the summary statistics so that the meana and median etc for each state can be compared against each other. 

Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.

A simple table containing the statistics as linked below is one of the ways:

A graphical view as linked below is also useful with good visualization:

In the attached pdf, they have a line chart showing the mean and median which is a good way to visualize.
